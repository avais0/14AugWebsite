        <h1>History of Pakistan</h1>
        <section class="history-content">
            <h2>Pre-Partition Era (Before 1947)</h2>
            <p>Before independence, the region now known as Pakistan was part of British India. The majority of Muslims in the subcontinent wanted a separate homeland where they could live according to their own religious and cultural values. The idea was formally introduced by <strong>Allama Iqbal</strong> in 1930 during his Allahabad Address. The Pakistan Resolution was passed on <strong>23rd March 1940</strong> at Lahore, demanding a separate state for Muslims.</p>

            <h2>Independence (1947)</h2>
            <p>On <strong>14th August 1947</strong>, Pakistan was created as an independent country under the leadership of <strong>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong>. Pakistan was formed from the Muslim-majority areas of British India: West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan) and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).</p>

            <h2>Early Challenges (1947–1958)</h2>
            <p>Pakistan faced immediate challenges like refugee settlement, administrative setup, lack of resources, and the Kashmir conflict. The first constitution was adopted in <strong>1956</strong>, declaring Pakistan the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.</p>

            <h2>Separation of East Pakistan (1971)</h2>
            <p>Political and economic differences led to the separation of East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh in 1971.</p>

            <h2>Modern Era (1971–Present)</h2>
            <p>Pakistan has seen periods of democratic and military rule. It became a nuclear power in <strong>1998</strong>. Today, the nation continues to develop in infrastructure, technology, and education while facing challenges like poverty, corruption, and terrorism.</p>
